# Bloggify
This is a blog social media website that i had.
Its something i've always thought was missing on the internet; i know we have reddit but i feel as though a website which can connect people to real blogs
(pref. using squarespace's methods of creating the website). 
Primary reasons of creating such an website is to connect those that want to view blogs with those that want to cerate blogs.
